# Analysis of Infant Gut Microbiota and Its Relationship with Behavioral and Brain Variables

## 📌 General description

This repository contains the initial computational work associated with the **Bachelor’s Thesis (TFG)** of the **Degree in Food Science and Technology**.

At the current stage, the project focuses on a **preliminary genomic screening task**, consisting of identifying *Bifidobacterium* species that **possess or lack the hutH gene** using publicly available data from **NCBI**. This task serves as a **proof of concept** and as a methodological foundation for later stages of the thesis.

The complete TFG will integrate **gut microbiota**, **behavioral**, and **brain-related data from children of different ages**, once access to these datasets is granted. All analyses are conducted using **Python**, primarily through **Jupyter notebooks**, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

---

## 🎯 Project objectives

- To identify *Bifidobacterium* strains using publicly available genomic data.
- To explore genomic differences within the *Bifidobacterium* genus related to histidine metabolism based on the **presence or absence of the hutH gene**.
- To develop a Python-based computational workflow for querying and analyzing NCBI genomic data.
- To lay the groundwork for future integration with microbiota, behavioral, and brain-related datasets.

## 🧪 Types of data analyzed

At the current stage, the project focuses on **genomic microbiological data** obtained from public databases:

- **Genomic data (NCBI)**
  - *Bifidobacterium* genomes
  - Presence or absence of the **hutH** gene (histidine ammonia-lyase)
  - Gene annotations and protein sequences

Future stages of the project may include:
- Gut microbiota composition data
- Behavioral and dietary variables
- Brain-related or neurodevelopmental data

## 🛠️ Technologies and libraries used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Main libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `Biopython`

(Additional libraries will be incorporated as the project progresses)

## ⚙️ Analysis methodology

1. **Exploratory and preparatory work (current stage)**
   - Manual and programmatic querying of NCBI databases
   - Screening *Bifidobacterium* genomes for the presence or absence of the **hutH** gene
   - Documentation of results using Jupyter notebooks

2. **Reproducible notebook-based workflow**
   - Analyses implemented entirely in Jupyter notebooks
   - Emphasis on clarity, traceability, and reproducibility rather than software engineering complexity

3. **Planned future analyses**
   - Integration of genomic findings with gut microbiota composition data from children
   - Association analyses with behavioral and brain-related variables across age groups
   - Statistical and multivariate analyses to explore microbiota–brain–behavior relationships
